This Visual Basic, Excel &amp; Python software enables you to track daily headcount, and find patterns with respect to assembly line performance based upon where you place assembly workers or machines on a line, while also producing a compelling, attractive and easily comprehensible chart of each days layout. The elegant combination of attractive charts, built-in summarization functionalities, and mathematical abstractions ideal for Machine Learning will enable you to find the most effective use of labor in your facility. NOTE: An extended version of this software is also available that serves as a labor dashboard and tracks attendance, disciplinary infractions, training and performance with respect to worker skill while producing all of the lower version outputs as well, but is only available for a fee with a special license.
